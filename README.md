# Ring_Caher_GraphicalEngine


Creating a graphic engine using WebGl and Javascript (Low level of abstraction) without pre-made Libraries to able to showcase a video game .The goal was to create from scratch a video game and its shaders without using any pre-built libraries. To do so we would use JavaScript as instruction given by the CPU and GLSL for implementing the shaders within the GPU. The API used to allow communication is WebGL.

Namely , with the engine you will (at least) be able to use different techniques such as:

Rendering Tehcniques:
-Scan Line rendering
-Ray casting

Light Models:
-Directional
-Point light
-Spot Ligths

BRDF Models:
Diffuse: Lambert, Toon
Specular: Phong, Blinn ,Toon
and Physical Based rendering .

Movement:
Quaternion and interpolation.
